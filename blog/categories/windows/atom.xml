    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/">LibCurl</a> is an open-source client-side URL transfer utility supporting multiple protocols. LibCurl is supported by almost every conceivable common platform, making it one of the most versatile libraries of its kind.</p>

<p>In this post, I will show you how to use LibCurl in C to make simple HTTP requests with its built-in cookie processor to programmatically log in to websites and download web pages.</p>

<h2>Setup / Installation</h2>

<p>Download the LibCurl for your platform form <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/download.html">here</a>. I would be using it on Windows with MinGW compiler and hence downloaded <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/gknw.net/7.34.0/dist-w32/curl-7.34.0-devel-mingw32.zip">Win32 &ndash; Generic</a> build. I extracted the zip file and copied the contents of &ldquo;include&rdquo; and &ldquo;lib&rdquo; folder to MinGW&rsquo;s &ldquo;include&rdquo; and &ldquo;lib&rdquo; folders respectively. That&rsquo;s it, you are ready to write your C program.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Retrieving a Webpage</h2>

<p>The program which I am going to write will POST the login data to a login page, retrieve the cookie and use it for downloading webpage.</p>

<p>First we need to include LibCurl&rsquo;s header file</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">h1</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="n">include</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">lt</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">curl</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">curl</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">h</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="n">h1</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Now we need to initialize the LibCurl globally as below</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="n">curl_global_init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">CURL_GLOBAL_ALL</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>This will initialize the LibCurl&rsquo;s module. Now we need to create a handle to make HTTP requests.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="n">CURL</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">myHandle</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">CURLcode</span> <span class="n">result</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// We&amp;rsquo;ll store the result of CURL&amp;rsquo;s webpage retrieval, for simple error checking.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">myHandle</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">curl_easy_init</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Now we will define our user agent as some websites reject HTTP requests without a proper user agent. We&rsquo;ll also specify for LibCurl to follow redirects, as many login pages redirect users to a home screen. Remember, we only need to do this once. LibCurl will keep these settings in effect unless we change them.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="n">curl_easy_setopt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">curl</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">CURLOPT_USERAGENT</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">ldquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">Mozilla</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mf">4.0</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">rdquo</span><span class="p">;);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">curl_easy_setopt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">curl</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">CURLOPT_AUTOREFERER</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">curl_easy_setopt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">curl</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Next, we&rsquo;ll enable LibCurl&rsquo;s automatic processing of cookies.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="n">curl_easy_setopt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">curl</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">ldquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">rdquo</span><span class="p">;);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;ll tell LibCurl which URL to fetch.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="n">curl_easy_setopt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">myHandle</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">CURLOPT_URL</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">ldquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://www.example.com&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="n">http</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="c1">//www.example.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s visit the login page once to obtain a PHPSESSID cookie.
<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="n">curl_easy_perform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">myHandle</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Next forge the HTTP referer field, or website will deny the login.
<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="n">curl_easy_setopt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">myHandle</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">CURLOPT_REFERER</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://www.example.com&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="n">http</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="c1">//www.example.com&lt;/a&gt;);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;ll prepare the data to post to login form.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="o">=&amp;</span><span class="n">ldquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">your_username_here</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">amp</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">password</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">your_password_here</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">rdquo</span><span class="p">;;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">curl_easy_setopt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">curl</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>You may have to change data string according to the structure of login page. Next we&rsquo;ll make the second HTTP POST request to obtain the real page.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="n">curl_easy_perform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">myHandle</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>And lastly we&rsquo;ll cleanup.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="n">curl_easy_cleanup</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">myHandle</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

    <updated>2009-06-29T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://pranavprakash.net/blog/2009/06/29/how-to-create-custom-ie8-accelerator</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has introduced a new feature in Internet Explorer 8 called &ldquo;Accelerators&rdquo;. These accelerators help you quickly perform your everyday browsing tasks without navigating to other websites to get things done. Simply highlight text from any webpage, and then click on the blue Accelerator icon that appears above your selection to perform the respective task.</p>

<!--more-->


<div style="TEXT-ALIGN: center;"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__GfZLYkxICU/Skj6BrTx--I/AAAAAAAALGs/ctho7T6mIYE/s400/d_screenshot_accelerator.jpg" /></div>


<h2>How to create an &ldquo;Accelerator&rdquo;?</h2>

<p>Well it&rsquo;s a pretty simple two step process:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create XML file</li>
<li>Create accelerator installation link</li>
</ol>


<p>Let us create a simple accelerator which queries IMDB for movie titles and displays the result.</p>

<h2>IMDB Accelerator</h2>

<p>On closer observation, we find that URL for search page of IMDB is of form</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/find?q=SearchString">http://www.imdb.com/find?q=SearchString</a></p>

<p>where &ldquo;SearchString&rdquo; is the string you are querying for. With this information, lets start making the accelerator.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Create XML File</h2>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'><span class="ni">&amp;lt;</span>?xml version=<span class="ni">&amp;ldquo;</span>1.0<span class="ni">&amp;rdquo;</span> encoding=<span class="ni">&amp;ldquo;</span>UTF-8<span class="ni">&amp;rdquo;</span>?&gt;
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;openServiceDescription</span> <span class="na">xmlns=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/schemas/openservicedescription/1.0&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;homepageUrl&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://www.imdb.com&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>http://www.imdb.com<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> <span class="nt">&lt;/homepageUrl&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;display&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="nt">&lt;name&gt;</span>Search IMDB <span class="nt">&lt;/name&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="nt">&lt;icon&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://www.imdb.com/favicon.ico&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>http://www.imdb.com/favicon.ico<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> <span class="nt">&lt;/icon&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/display&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;activity</span> <span class="na">category=</span><span class="s">&quot;Search&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;activityAction</span> <span class="na">context=</span><span class="s">&quot;selection&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="nt">&lt;execute</span> <span class="na">action=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://www.imdb.com/find&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;parameter</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;q&quot;</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">&quot;{selection}&quot;</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;text&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="nt">&lt;/execute&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/activityAction&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/activity&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/openServiceDescription&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>This XML file is called the service description file and it contains specific description about the service provider and type of service it provides. The {selection} value on Line 11 refers to the text that you may highlight on a web page before performing the search. Save this file as search.xml.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Create accelerator installation link</h2>

<p>To let users use our accelerator, we will create a install button. Users can install the accelerator using this link. Here the code for link:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;javascript:window.external.AddService(&#39;http://pranavprakash.net/blog/search.xml&#39;)&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Install Accelerator<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it, you are done. Install the accelerator and start searching.</p>

<div style="TEXT-ALIGN: center;"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__GfZLYkxICU/Skjr2D4faUI/AAAAAAAALGk/ys4EzTCU2fk/s400/imdb_accelerator.jpg" /></div>


<p>You will find your accelerator in &ldquo;All Accelerators&rdquo; context menu item.</p>

<h2>Manual Registry Tweak</h2>

<p>Go to start menu and in search or run box type regedit and press enter to open registry editor. Now browse to following registry key:
<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<div style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img src="http://pranavprakash.net/images/blog/openwithnp.png" /></div>


<p>Right-click on &ldquo;shell&rdquo; and choose to create a new key &ldquo;Open with Notepad&rdquo;. Create a new key below that one called &ldquo;command&rdquo;. Double-click on the (Default) value in the right-hand pane and enter in the following:
<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

Make sure you assign the appropriate JAVA_HOME value in batch files, according to your Java installation. Whenever you want to switch between Java versions, just run the respective batch file and you are done.</p>

<p><em>Note- <strong>JAVA_HOME</strong> and the path to <strong>java</strong> must <strong>always</strong> refer to the exact same version of the JDK. If you mix them up, unpredictable things will happen!</em></p>
