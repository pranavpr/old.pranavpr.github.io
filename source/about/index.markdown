I'm a Software Developer presently working at [Oracle](http://oracle.com "Oracle") Bangalore. I completed my B. Tech. (Hons.) in Electrical Engineering from [IIT Kharagpur](http://iitkgp.ac.in "IIT Kharagpur"). I code in many languages for work and for play. When I'm not coding, I take pictures ([Flickr](http://flickr.com/itzpranav "Pranav's Photo Stream")), read ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/pranavpr "Pranav's Goodreads Profile")), cook or play with my pet [Logan](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151702773147265.1073741837.542132264&type=1&l=af846d5988 "Cute Logan").
