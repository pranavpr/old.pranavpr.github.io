Hello World! Welcome to my new blog. I am Pranav Prakash, currently working as Associate Applications Engineer at Oracle India Pvt. Ltd. in Peoplesoft Enterprise Tools division. I have completed my B. Tech. in Electrical Engineering from IIT Kharagpur in May 2008. Since then I'm working for Oracle. Up till now, my stay at Oracle has been very much knowledge enriching. I would be posting tips, tricks and work-arounds which I have learned from my experiences in this blog.
